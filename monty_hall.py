The Monty Hall Problem

In the first chapter, Allen B. Downey introduces the Monty Hall problem:

Monty shows you three closed doors and tells you that there is a prize 
behind each door: one prize is a car, the other two are less valuable 
prizes like peanut butter and fake fingernails. The prizes are arranged 
at random.

The object of the game is to guess which door has the car. If you guess 
right, you get to keep the car.

You pick a door, which we will call Door A. Weâ€™ll call the other doors B 
and C. Before opening the door you chose, Monty increases the suspense by 
opening either Door B or C, whichever does not have the car. (If the car 
is actually behind Door A, Monty can safely open B or C, so he chooses one 
at random.)

Then Monty offers you the option to stick with your original choice or switch 
to the one remaining unopened door.

SHOULD YOU STAY OR SWITCH?

Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to show that the best strategy is to switch.

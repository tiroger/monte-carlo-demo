# Monte Carlo Method

Invented by John von Neumann (pictured) and Stanislaw Ulam at Los Alamos, and named after the world-famous casino in the eponymous district of the city-state of Monaco, Monte Carlo (MC) methods are a class of  powerful algorithms that rely on random sampling of a probability distribution, or the simulation of random variables, to compute a solution to a given problem.

Monte Carlo (MC) methods, named after the world-famous casino in the eponymous district of the city-state of Monaco, are a class of powerful algorithms that rely on random sampling of a probability distribution, and the Law of Large Numbers (LLN), to compute a solution to a given problem. It was conceived by Stanislaw Ulam (Pictured) and developed with the collaboration of John von Neumann while working on the Manhattan Project. MC methods were central to the complex simulations required to solve deterministic problems, such as neutron diffusion in fissionable material, during the development of nuclear weapons.
